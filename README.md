# Getting Started with HCL Workload Automation Monitoring App
The HWA Monitoring overview dashboard provides a single, consolidated view for monitoring the workload status. By selecting the dashboard on the list, you can see the information related to that dashboard. 

**HWA Monitoring Overview Dashboard** 

In the HWA Monitoring overview Dashboard, you can view the whole status of your workload at a glance for one or more of the engines you have configured.  

**Overview Dashboard**: 
 ![Install App](screenshots/overview-dashboard.PNG)

By clicking a button or menu option, you open a new tab displaying the selected dashboard information. The following dashboards are supported: 

- **Jobs and Job Streams**. This dashboard shows the status of Jobs, Critical jobs and Job Streams. 

  Source of Information: HWA Deployment events sidecar container and HWA server Logs.

- **KPIs and Workstations**. This dashboard shows the HCL Workload Automation KPIs information for each host and allows drilldown to see the timeseries data in visual representation for defined KPIs.

  Source of Information : API exposed by HWA Server on port 31116.
   
- **Activity Monitoring**. This dashboard shows details of workstations and audit information such as user actions. Users can view audit information for selected time range, user and object. 

  Source of Information:  HWA Deployment sidecar audit containers, for example: waserver-db-auditing, waserver-plan-auditing etc. 

- **Infra Monitoring**.  This dashboard provides an overview of the infrastructure details of HCL Workload Automation deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Filter by your Kubernetes namespace and view the dashboard as shown below:
 ![](screenshots/infra-filter.PNG)
  Source of Information: Infrastructure Logs exposed by Kubernetes/Openshift cluster. 

- **Alerts Dashboard**. The HWA monitoring application comes with predefined alerts configured as an example. User can navigate to alerts page and easily enable/disable these alerts when needed. The statistical reports and graphical visualizations of the alerts created for HWA application can be viewed in HWA Alerts dashboard. Follow this [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.4/Analytics/Alerts) to manage alerts (create new,enable & disable,etc...). in Splunk application.
Follow this [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.4/Alert/Emailnotification) to configure the email setting in the Splunk application.

The following table shows some of the out-of-the-box alert definitions that come with the HWA Monitoring Application:
| Monitor Name	| Severity | Trigger Condition |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| WA_Broker_Status	| Critical | ==0 (more than 5 minutes) |
| WA_server_link_status | Critical |	==0 (more than 5 minutes) |
| WA_DB_connected |	Critical |	==0 (more than 30 sec) |
| WA_Agent_running |	Critical |	==0 (more than 5 minute) |
| WA_FINAL_Error |	Critical |	==1 (more than 30 sec) |
| WA_FINAL_Late |	Critical |	==1 (more than 30 sec) |
| WA_LicenseUncounted |	Critical |	> 0 (more than 1day) |
| *WA_UI_Available* |	Critical |	HTTP code != 200 |
| *WA_Master_Available* |	Critical |	HTTP code != 200 |
| WA_DB_connected_Warning |	Low	|==0 (more than 10 sec) |
| WA_LicenseUncounted_Warning |	Low	|> 0 (more than 70 min) |

**Note: By default, all the above alerts are disabled. You need to enable them based on your requirements.**

The *WA_UI_Available* and *WA_Master_Available* alert definitions needs to be updated with your HWA Console and HWA Server environment URLs respectively. So, follow this [Splunk doumentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.4/Alert/Alertspage#Edit_an_alert_search) to edit the alert definitions.

 14. Q: Does Splunk support adding multiple severity for an alert? For example, an alert could be triggered as LOW severity based on some thresholds, and as HIGH severity based on other thresholds. Can I configure both conditions for the alert? 
       
     A:  No, Splunk does not support adding complex alerts and adding multiple severity for an alert. Alternatively, you can create two different alerts and add the severity based on its conditions. 
    
  15. Q:  Alerts/Emails are triggered very frequently, sending emails repeatedly. How can I avoid this? 
        
      A:  A frequently triggered alert indicates that alert is configured with a low throttle time (time interval). You can increase the throttle time by editing the alert, selecting the throttle checkbox, and entering *Suppress triggering for* the time interval needed between the subsequent triggers of the alert. For example, if *Suppress triggering for* is set to 1 hour, the alert triggers every hour.
